# Wordament-Solver
Wordament Solver is a program that lists out all the word possibilities on a given wordament board. This program came from an
excercise I did related to something similar to Wordament, and I thought it would be fun to mess around with it a bit.
The program is only as accurate as the dictionary file included with it is (when compared to the official Wordament Dictionary).
The dictionary file can be changed or replaced to increase accuracy. This program has been proven to bring you into first place in Wordament is used properly.
